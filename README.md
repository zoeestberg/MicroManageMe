# MicroManageMe
_Python Project Group 1_

The purpose of this package is to create multiple Outlook appointments for course assigments based on data inputed by the user. The appointment parameters addressed in the first vesion of this package include subject title, start date, end date and body text. Additionally, reminders for the appointments are determined based on the weight associated with each course on the final grade.

**Motivation**

Our motivation to develop this course comes from the frustration we face as students manually inputting assignments or exams into our Outlook calendars at the beginning of an academic semester. This process is very tedious and is unnecessarily time consuming, so we decided to make it easier. MicroManageMe was produced using resources provided by the University of Florida for EML4930 Special Topics: Python for Engineers.

**Build Status**

We are unaware of any bugs and would welcome any testing by the GitHub community. We have only tested this package on 3 machines with 2 Outlook accounts, so one concern is the automatic use of Outlook with the win32 API. So far in our testing, we have not ran into an issue with Outlook credentials. If appointments are not created automatically in your Outlook application, then please comment that bug on our repository page.

**Code Style**

No particular code style was implemented except for the use of camel case as a naming convention for functions.
